Creating  RSS Data Models:
The rssData.rb file contain the data models we will be using to manage and store RSS Data from an online RSS Feed. We will need to create 2 Data Models, the RssChannel Model to store information about the RSS Feed, and the RssItem Model to store the data from the items inside an RssChannel.
